                        <p>Sinulog is held in celebration of one of the country’s most famous historic relics: the Santo Niño de Cebú. This was the statue of the baby Jesus that was handed to the Rajah Humabon of Cebu by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.

                            This was one of the most important events in the religious history of the Philippines as it paved the way to the birth of Christianity in the country. At the moment of receiving the holy image, it was said that Queen Juana, the main consort of Rajah Humabon, danced with joy holding this image of the child Jesus.

The other natives followed her example, and this event was regarded as the first Sinulog dance. The same event was used as the basis for most Sinulog dances. <br>At the moment of receiving the holy image, it was said that Queen Juana, the main consort of Rajah Humabon, danced with joy holding this image of the child Jesus.

<br>
<p>The Sinulog dance steps are also believed to originate from Baladhay, Rajah Humabon's adviser. When Baladhay got sick, Humabon ordered his tribe to bring Baladhay into a room where the Santo Niño was enthroned.

    After a few days, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing by the native tribe. Baladhay was asked as to why was he was shouting and dancing. He pointed at the image of the holy Jesus and explained that baby Jesus was tickling him.  
    
    In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was dancing the movements of the river. To this day, the two-steps forward, the one-step backward movement is still used by Santo Niño devotees who believe that it was the Santo Niño's choice to have Baladhay dance.</p><br>
    <p>The Grand Street Parade, which is the focal event for Sinulog Festival, normally starts on the third Sunday of January at around 8 or 9 in the morning. On Sunday night, there are pyromusical shows that will treat you to a beautiful display of fireworks. There are also a series of fun events organized days and weeks prior to the main festival.</p>
