                  <p class="lead">The church of the Holy Child was founded by Fray Andrés de Urdaneta, O.S.A. on April 28, 1565, the day when the image of the Holy Child was found in a partially burned hut. More than a week passed after the rediscovery of the image on May 8, 1565, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi initiated the founding of the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. On the spot of the house where the image of the Santo Niño was found, the monastery of the Holy Name of Jesus was constructed.

                    The first church to be built on the site where the image of the Holy Child was found was burned down on November 1, 1566. It was said to be built by Fr. Diego de Herrera using wood and nipa. Fray Pedro Torres, O.S.A. started the construction of a new church in 1605. It was finished in 1626 but was again burned in March 1628. Fray Juan Medina, O.S.A.[10] started the construction of another church that year, using stone and bricks, a great innovation at that time. Construction was stopped because the structure was found to be defective.</p>

                  <p class="lead">The Simala Shrine is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site. The site hosts the image of Our Lady of Lindogon, which is believed to be miraculous by devotees of the Virgin Mary; subsequent to its reported shedding of tears, it was credited with the healing of those who were afflicted with dengue in the area in 1998.[4] The image has since that time reportedly shed tears on four more occasions, the latest being on September 8, 2016. The image, originally assigned as that of Our Lady of Fatima, was donated to the Marian Monks by Terry Brooks from Pampanga. The construction of the Simala Shrine is also believed to be the realization of a prediction by Ingko Niyong Villamor that the hills of Lindogon, the current site of the shrine, would become "holy" once a "miraculous white lady reign in the place".</p>

                  <p class="lead">The Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral, officially known as the Metropolitan Cathedral and Parish of St. Vitalis and of the Immaculate Conception (dedicated to Mary, under her title, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and to Saint Vitalis of Milan), is the ecclesiastical seat of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Cebu in Cebu, Philippines.[1] Cebu was established as a diocese on August 14, 1595. It was elevated as a metropolitan archdiocese on April 28, 1934, with the dioceses of Dumaguete, Maasin, Tagbilaran, and Talibon as suffragans. Before being raised as a primatial church in Cebu, the church was one of the first churches in the Philippines (besides the Basilica del Santo Niño) dedicated to St. Vitalis and built near the fort in April 1565 by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, Fray Andrés de Urdaneta and Fray Diego de Herrera.</p>

                  <p class="lead">The Carcar Church exhibits the form of a basilica. Its complex also host a separate building which is intended and used as a convent. It is built using coral stones with part of its structure, specifically its upper stories and ceiling made using hardwood. The structure is of mixed architecture style. Parts of the structure exhibit examples of Neo-Mudéjar, Revival Baroque, and Austrian Baroque architecture. Its wooden choir loft is of Gothic Revival character. The church building is also described as having Greco-Roman and Muslim influence.The convent building also has characteristics of the indigenous bahay na bato.[1]

                    The church's ceiling is decorated by Cebuano artist Canuto Avila which was commissioned by Fr. Anastasio Nuñez del Corro. The ceiling mural was executed from 1910s to the 1920s</p>

                    <span class="text-body-secondary"></span></h2><br>
                  <p class="lead">The bell tower has three levels supporting a single large bell on the second level, with 8 smaller bells on the third. The base of the belfry supports a square plan, while the second and third bases follow an octagonal plan, topped by a domed roof. The bell tower is connected to the church by a single-level baptistry.

                    The convent at the right side of the church served as a seminary during the early part of the 19th century. Today the convent serves as a home for the Pastors assigned in the parish. The basement or the 1st floor of the convent housed the parish office, and offices of the EMHC, Catechists and the Parish Youth Coordinating Council. Adjacent to the parish office is the "Museo de la Parroquia de San Miguel" an ecclesiastical museum with a rich collection of artifacts which became a favorite of the balikbayans and tourists. At the left of the church structure is the site of the former town cemetery, which now serve as the church complex's gethsemane garden. </p>
